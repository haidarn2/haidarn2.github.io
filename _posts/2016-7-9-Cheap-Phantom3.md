title: Getting a DJI Phantom 3 for as cheap as possible in Canada
---

Like many friend circles, every year during christmas time my friends and I have a secret Santa exchange. To spice things up last year, we upped the price limit to a hefty $50.

On the day of the exchange, I was suprised to see that I got a Hubsan X4 H107L quadcopter from my good buddy Ali. Over the course of several months I learned to fly this fully manual mini-quad with decent precision and came to the conclusion that I wanted to get a larger drone.

The current leader in consumer and professional drones is none other than DJI, a chinese company at the forefront of the industry since 2013. DJI has released a number of drone lines including their widely popular "Phantom Series" in 2013. There have been 4 revisions of the Phantom Series, each one released approximately one year apart from each other. The most notable revision is the Phantom 3, due to the variety of sub models available.

There are 3 Phantom 3 SKU's. At the top we have the Professional for $1000 USD, touting a 4k Camera and Lightbridge for the video downlink, allowing for 5km range. The midrange option is the Phantom 3 Advanced for $799 USD, this time with a 2.7k camera, and lightbridge for again 5km range. Finally at the botom we have the Phantom 3 Standard for $500 USD, featuring a 2.7k camera, this time with WiFi downlink, limiting the range to 1km.

|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Model** | **STANDARD** | **ADVANCED** | **PROFESSIONAL** |
| **Flight Time** | ~25 Min | ~23 Min | ~23 Min |
| **Camera** | 2.7k @ 30fps | 2.7k @ 30fps | 4k @ 30fps |
| **Downlink** | WiFi (1 km) | LightBridge (5 km) | LightBridge (5 km) |
| **Price** | $499 USD | $799 USD | $1000 USD |


Naturally I did not want to spend a fortune on my first "real" drone so I looked into several  "phantom clones" at the $300-$400 range. All the options I looked at were lacking in one shape or another; either lacking a gimbal, proper software, gps, or just plagued by stupid design choices like the Hubsan H501S transmitter uses 4x AA batteries that will only last ~15 minutes instead of a rechargable Li-Po battery.

Compared to the Phantom 3 Standard at $499, these clones pail in comparison.

*Spoiler alert, I got a Phantom 3 Standard.*

#### The Canadian Shackle

As America's hat, it comes with no surprise to anyone living in Canada how much more we have to pay compared to our american cousins for the same things. The Phantom 3 is no exception. At the time of writing the Phantom 3 Standard retails for $679.99 CAD at most retail stores. This doesn't seem too bad until you factor in the 13% tax to get a bold asking price of $768.38 CAD.

*I Mean atleast we get free shipping right?? :'(*

***Q**: Can't we just buy a phantom 3 from the states? I mean its just $499 with no tax there if you buy out of state, right?*

***A**: I wish things were that simple, anything you buy from the states gets slapped with duties when it crosses the border and you end up getting hit with massive brokerage fees at the door equaling more than just buying locally. So buying a Phantom 3 from amazon.com for $499 USD and shipping to Canada is **not** a good idea.*

#### The Frugality Loophole

As someone who spends an hour googling around for last second coupon codes before completing a purchase, it was no surprise that I did the same with my Phantom. I stumbled upon a forum post appropriately titled ["Important information for Canadians"](http://forum.dji.com/thread-19852-1-1.html) on the DJI forums. In there they describe how DJI covers any brokerage fees accumulated when buying and shipping through their online store. This is answered in question #5 on DJI's FAQ page [here](http://www.dji.com/support/purchase#shipping_and_delivery).

*The excerpt from the FAQ page. I couldn't believe it either, I mean they could be paying upwards of $200 in brokerage fees!*

Great so this leads us into two options for getting a Phantom 3.

**Option 1: Buy New**

This is my preferred option, and ultimately what I ended up going with. I say this because in addition to not paying any tax nor duties I also recieved a 10% educational discount code from DJI. [here](http://store.dji.com/get-discount/edu?site=brandsite).

![DJI educational discount page](http://i.imgur.com/1626Ayz.png)
*Simply provide your university email and you'll recieve a 10% discount off your phantom 3. 10% is no joke, that's $50 USD.*

---

Next, the new Phantom 3 standard SKU can be found [here](http://store.dji.com/product/phantom-3-standard). Add the drone to your cart and apply the educational discount you recieved before.

*$499 USD. No tax. Free shipping. No Duties. What more can you ask for?*

**Option 2: Buy Refurbished**

If you're feeling a bit cheap, there's no shame with going with the cheaper option. You can get the [refurbished version of the Phantom 3 Standard for $419 USD](http://store.dji.com/product/phantom-3-standard-refurbished-unit), a solid $80 discount. That being said you can only get away with so much as the educational discount code mentioned earlier does not apply to refurbished products, so your price to performance ratio is slightly reduced here.

#### Recap

Let's do a bit of math really quick and see just how much we've actually saved by buying through DJI.com.

(Exchange rate as of July 9, 2016: 1 CAD = 0.77 USD)

|| Bestbuy.ca | Amazon.com | DJI.com NEW|DJI.com Refurbished|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Price** | $679.99 CAD | $499 USD | $499 USD | $419 USD |
| **Shipping** | FREE | FREE | FREE | FREE |
| **Discounts** | None | None | -10% ($50 USD) | None|
| **Tax** | 13% ($88.40 CAD) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Duties** | N/A | ~$100-$150 USD | $0 | $0 |
| **Total** | $768.40 CAD | ~$600-650 USD | $449 USD | $420 USD |
| **Total in CAD** |$768.40 CAD |~$782-847 CAD| $585.43 CAD|$547.62 CAD|

*So there you have it, you're saving approximately $183 CAD following this method compared to buying locally from Bestbuy. $220 if you buy a refurbished model.*
