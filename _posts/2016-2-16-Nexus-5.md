title: How to use your Nexus 5 without a Power Button.
---

LG's Nexus 5 has a divided fan-base. I've met people who swear by it, and others who despise it with every ounce of their existence.

Back in 2013, the 16GB variant was released at a mere $349, nearly half the price of comparable flagship phones.

It also supported nearly every service provider due to the fact that every Nexus 5 is factory unlocked and the fact that it supported nearly all radio bands split across two variants.

Despite all of this, my personal experience has led me to the realization that the Nexus 5 is a very poorly constructed phone. With so many issues plaguing the device, there was one issue that stood out in particular, the dreaded power button.
