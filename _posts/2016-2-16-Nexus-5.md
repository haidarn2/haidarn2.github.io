title: How to use your Nexus 5 without a Power Button.
---

LG's Nexus 5 has a divided fan-base. I've met people who swear by it, and others who despise it with every ounce of their existence.

Back in 2013, the 16GB variant was released at a mere $349, nearly half the price of comparable flagship phones.

It also supported nearly every service provider due to the fact that every Nexus 5 is factory unlocked and the fact that it supported nearly all radio bands split across two variants.

Despite all of this, my personal experience has led me to the realization that the Nexus 5 is a very poorly constructed phone. With so many issues plaguing the device, there was one issue that stood out in particular, the dreaded power button.

### The Problem

About two months ago, my good buddy Ali came to me with his bootlooping Nexus 5. No big deal I thought, probably a software issue that's preventing the phone from booting.

After some attempt at getting into the fastboot bootloader menu (more on this later), I realized the phone was bootlooping *too* fast. Some googling later I realized this was a widespread hardware problem with the tiny power switch registering itself as constantly being pressed.

Apparently the issue lies within the metal spring-like buckles inside the switch. The two metal buckles give the button a springy feel with a click when the button bottoms out. For some poor reasoning, the button manufacturer (presumably not LG since some Samsung phones have this issue too) decided that the buckles would give contact with the connecting circuit board via a small dab of solder.

Yeah I know. A dab of solder sounds as bad as it is, after some wear and tear the solder begins to wear onto the circuit board, indefinitely closing the circuit.

### The workaround

Let's take a look at several fixes that some people claim to work

#### Fix #1: Press the button really really fast several times to get it to stay on.

This hardly seems like a solution at all, the idea is you press the power button constantly to break the 2 second timer required by the phone to send the shutdown signal. Besides, the second you stop pressing the power button the phone will shutdown anyways as shown by this youtube video:

**Verdict? Not a good enough solution.**

#### Fix #2: Smack the backside of the phone on a flat surface.

WIP

#### Fix #3: Spray WD-40 into the power switch (Please **DO NOT** try this. seriously.)

WIP

#### Fix #4: Remap the power button to another button

WIP

#### Fix #5: Replace the power button
