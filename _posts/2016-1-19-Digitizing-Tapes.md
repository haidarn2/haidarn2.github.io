title: Digitizing 90's Camcorder tapes
---

If your family was anything like mine, then at some point you've likely owned one of those bulky, black, rectangular Sony Handycam camcorders from the 90's.

More specifically, my dad bought the Sony Handycam Hi8 sometime in 1995.

What the heck is Hi8?

You see back in the 80's and 90's JVC reigned supreme with their 'VHS-C' tapes that was the dominating standard on camcorder market. Sony decided that for their upcoming 'Handycam' line of camcorders they were going to release their own standard which featured similar video quality but significantly better audio quality awkwardly titled 'video8' (8 stands for 8mm). 

All was good for Sony until JVC released 'S-VHS-C' a much higher quality version of VHS that featured 480i lines of resolution (vs VHS's 240i). Quick to respond, Sony released their 'Hi8' standard, a revised version of 'video8' that also featured 480i lines of resolution.
