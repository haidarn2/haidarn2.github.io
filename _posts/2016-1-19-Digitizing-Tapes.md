title: Digitizing 90's Camcorder tapes
---

If your family was anything like mine, then at some point you've likely owned one of those bulky, black, rectangular Sony Handycam camcorders from the 90's.

More specifically, my dad bought this sad looking Sony Handycam Hi8 sometime in 1995.

##### What the heck is Hi8?

You see back in the 80's and 90's JVC reigned supreme with their 'VHS-C' tapes that was the dominating standard on camcorder market. Sony decided that for their upcoming 'Handycam' line of camcorders they were going to release their own standard which featured similar video quality but significantly better audio quality awkwardly titled 'video8' (8 stands for 8mm). 

All was good for Sony until JVC released 'S-VHS-C' a much higher quality version of VHS that featured 480i lines of resolution (vs VHS's 240i). Quick to respond, Sony released their 'Hi8' standard, a revised version of 'video8' that also featured 480i lines of resolution.


##### Onto the point..

After going through some of my old belongings, I came across the forgotten camcorder along with 5 or 6 tapes that have not been played in over 10 years! (The tapes date from 1995 - 2006) 

Crossing my fingers hoping the tapes haven't deteriortated magnetically, I inserted the tape labeled 95 and.. Success! I guess thanks to my dad for spending the extra money to buy the genuine Sony gold quality branded tapes instead of going for a more economical option. 

Digitizing 8mm tapes on these older analog only cameras is somewhat of a laborous process, we need a tuner
